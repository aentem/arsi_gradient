The aim of this project is to determine whether building soil organic matter can increase the nutritional security of households in a smallholder wheat system in Ethiopia. We analyzed soil and crop samples along a distance-to-forest gradient, where samples closer to the forest had greater soil organic matter because of the legacy effect of pre-agricultural vegetation, and had greater micronutrient contents in wheat.
