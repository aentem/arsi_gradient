The aim of this project is to determine whether building soil organic matter can increase the nutritional security of households in a smallholder wheat system in Ethiopia. We analyzed soil and crop samples along a distance-to-forest gradient, where samples closer to the forest had greater soil organic matter because of the legacy effect of pre-agricultural vegetation, and had greater micronutrient contents in wheat.

## Data archive
[Data for this analysis are achived on KNB](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1MP51GH)

Test the effect of distance-to-forest on POM C for wheat fields separately, and for homegardens separately. You found no effect (Table 3 to 5) but perhaps the effect ‘land use’ (forest, wheat, homegarden) is overruling and a significant distance-to-forest effect may be found when running the analysis for wheat fields and for homegardens separately (this would be an interesting finding).
 
Fit distance to forest as a categorical variable.
