Test the effect of distance-to-forest on POM C for wheat fields separately, and for homegardens separately. You found no effect (Table 3 to 5) but perhaps the effect ‘land use’ (forest, wheat, homegarden) is overruling and a significant distance-to-forest effect may be found when running the analysis for wheat fields and for homegardens separately (this would be an interesting finding).
 
Fit distance to forest as a categorical variable.
